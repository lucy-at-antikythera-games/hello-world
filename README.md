Repo for learning my way around Github

Lucy here. Beginner programmer. I dabbled in a year of Java several years ago, a year of Python more recently, and bit of HTML and CSS via Codecademy. I'm learning some C# and Unity. Not very disciplined, but I've joined a group of the awesomest people to work with, so I hope we'll make great things!
